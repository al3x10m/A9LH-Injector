# A9LH-NAND.bin-Injector
_A arm9loaderhax installer to be used from PC_

## Warning
__!This is not intended to replace existing solutions!__ Use [SafeA9LHInstaller](https://github.com/AuroraWright/SafeA9LHInstaller/releases) if you can. This is only intended to be used in those cases where you cannot run one of the existing solutions on your console. A hardmod is recommended wheen using this, because safety checks are not possible from PC, and any mistake from your side will result in a __brick__.

## What you need
Most of these things can be dumped from your console via either [OTPHelper](https://github.com/d0k3/OTPHelper/releases) or [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP/releases). For the OTP.bin, refer to [Plailects guide](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki). Don't use stuff from other consoles.
* A dump of your NAND (typically called `NAND.bin`)
* The FIRM0FIRM1.xorpad
* Your OTP.bin
* new3ds90.firm, new3ds10.firm and secret_sector.bin - for more info, see [here](https://github.com/delebile/arm9loaderhax/blob/master/README.md)
