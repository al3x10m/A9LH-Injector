# A9LH Injector
_A arm9loaderhax installer to be used from PC_

## Warning
__!This is not intended to replace existing solutions!__ Use [SafeA9LHInstaller](https://github.com/AuroraWright/SafeA9LHInstaller/releases) if you can. This is only intended to be used in those cases where you cannot run one of the existing solutions on your console. A hardmod is recommended when using this, because safety checks are not possible from PC, and any mistake from your side will result in a __brick__.

## What you need
Most of these things can be dumped from your console via either [OTPHelper](https://github.com/d0k3/OTPHelper/releases) or [Decrypt9WIP](https://github.com/d0k3/Decrypt9WIP/releases). For the OTP.bin, refer to [Plailects guide](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki). Don't use stuff from other consoles.
* a dump of your NAND, called `NAND.bin` - __this will be modified, keep backups__
* the `FIRM0FIRM1.xorpad`
* your `OTP.bin` 
* `new3ds90.firm`, `new3ds10.firm` and `secret_sector.bin` - for more info, see [here](https://github.com/delebile/arm9loaderhax/blob/master/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-5-(arm9loaderhax)) (search for `data_input.zip`)
* `payload_stage1.bin` and `payload_stage2.bin` - [here](https://github.com/delebile/arm9loaderhax) to compile for yourself, or `payload_input.zip` from [here](https://github.com/Plailect/Guide/wiki/Part-5-(arm9loaderhax))

## How to run
Just put all files mentioned above, except the `NAND.bin` and `FIRM0FIRM1.xorpad`, into the `/Ã¬nput` folder. Put `NAND.bin` and `FIRM0FIRM1.xorpad` into the root folder containing `A9LHinjector.bat`. Run `A9LHinjector.bat`. Arm9loaderhax will be installed to your NAND dump, and the NAND dump will be renamed to `nand.a9lh.bin`.
